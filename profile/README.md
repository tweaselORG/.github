# Tweaselâ€”A Datenanfragen.de e. V. project

Tweasel is a project building infrastructure for detecting and complaining about tracking and privacy violations in mobile apps on Android and iOS.

The project is still under active development. So far, we developed a tool suite for automated app analysis and tracking detections. You can find more details about that in our [documentation](https://docs.tweasel.org/). If you want to follow along with the development, have a look at our [devlog](https://www.datarequests.org/devlog). You can also join our [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#dade-tweasel:matrix.altpeter.me) to get in touch.

The project is run by a privacy-focused non-profit, Datenanfragen.de e.&thinsp;V., who also runs the website [datarequests.org](https://www.datarequests.org), among others. It [receives funds](https://nlnet.nl/project/TrackingWeasel/) from the Zero Entrust fund in the European Commission's Next Generation Internet program via the NLnet foundation.
